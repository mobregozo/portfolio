# Resume - Portfolio 

This is a small project I did to have a simple skeleton of an application that can be used as a resume/portfolio when presenting yourself to the rest of the world.
I have focused on having something simple with a clean UI.

Please, feel free to fork it and create your own!!

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
### Taildwind CSS
Low-level CSS [framework](https://tailwindcss.com/) that provides utility classes that let you build custom designs without ever leaving your HTML, and keeping your custom CSS files pretty small.

### Prismic
In order to load the posts I am writing I have use a CDN called [Prismic](https://prismic.io/)

### Netlify
I personally used Netlify to deploy and host the website, and I recommend this because of its simplicity.

[Google Fonts loader](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/): I used this tool to get the necessary info when loading custom fonts locally, without using the CDN to prevent render blocking resources

[Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/): All the SVGs are part of Ionicons.

The Design of this website is inspired by the following two projects:
- https://github.com/wahyuway/nuxtjs-resume-template
