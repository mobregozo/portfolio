      Besides work, I usually spend my free time outdoors playing sports and
      travelling around, taking pictures of everything I see.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2 mt-2 text-gray-700 font-semibold ">
      Related to sports I am passionate about football, love to read and talk
      about it, and of course play as much as I can.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2 mt-2 text-gray-700 font-semibold ">
      When I am not running outside, I am behind my drums, instrument that I
      play since I was a little kid, and I still enjoy playing the good old punk
      rock songs that I used to listen to when I was at high school.
